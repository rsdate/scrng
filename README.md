## Introduction

The Shadow algorithm is an algorithm for generating random digits that utilizes an standard (and popular) algorithm as the core generator. This algorithm is called LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register). The algorithm first uses LFSR to generate a random string of digits. The algorithm then uses Python's built-in random number generator the further scramble the output of the LFSR.

## Installation
You can check out this repository directly and then build the
package:
```
git clone https://github.com/rsdate/scrng
cd scrng
pip install .
```
Or you can simply install the official package from my repository:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/rsdate/scrng.git@version
```
where ```version``` is the specific version of the package.

* **Note**: Installing from PyPI is not an option for this package

## A Simple Example (in Python)

```
import scrng.main as scrng
print(scrng.scrng())
```
Some dummy output:
```
['2460403941444260529181716075179723041634946086076450300405774318506821593208121188927143953150202887']
```
This example shows the barebones functionality of the ```scrng()``` function. See [Parameters](#parameters) for details about customizing the function.
## Parameters
* numsToGen (```int```): How many numbers to generate (default=1)
* lenOfSeed (```int```): How long the the returned numbers should be (default=100)
* strength (```tuple[int, list[int]]```): The first value determines the size of the core generator and the second value determines the taps for the generator (Read about [LFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register)) (default=(127, [1, 2, 7]))

## Notes
* The core algorithm ([LFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register)) generates numbers
in cycles of 5000. For x numbers to generate, the LFSR runs x / 5000 (rounded up) times. You can modify this
number if you would like.
* This generator doesn't implement seed functionally just yet. This notice will be removed when it does.
