A total of 155 tests (some of the 15 tests actually consist of multiple sub-tests)
were conducted to evaluate the randomness of 3239 bitstreams of 1024 bits from:

	/Users/rsdate/scrng/src/scrng/testData/combined.txt

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The numerous empirical results of these tests were then interpreted with
an examination of the proportion of sequences that pass a statistical test
(proportion analysis) and the distribution of p-values to check for uniformity
(uniformity analysis). The results were the following:

	0/155 tests passed successfully both the analyses.
	155/155 tests did not pass successfully both the analyses.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Here are the results of the single tests:

 - The "Frequency" test FAILED both the analyses.

 - The "Block Frequency" test FAILED both the analyses.

 - The "Cumulative Sums" (forward) test FAILED both the analyses.
   The "Cumulative Sums" (backward) test FAILED both the analyses.

 - The "Runs" test FAILED both the analyses.

 - The "Longest Run of Ones" test FAILED both the analyses.

 - The "Discrete Fourier Transform" test FAILED the uniformity analysis.

 - 148/148 of the "Non-overlapping Template Matching" tests FAILED both the analyses.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The missing tests (if any) were whether disabled manually by the user or disabled
at run time due to input size requirements not satisfied by this run.
